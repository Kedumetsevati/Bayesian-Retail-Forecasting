## 📘 Project Overview  
This project applies **Bayesian time-series forecasting** to predict retail sales and quantify uncertainty for improved operational planning.  
Using posterior predictive distributions instead of point forecasts, the model provides **credible intervals**—helping reduce stockouts, overstock, and inventory risk.

This approach is directly applicable to retail chains like **Costco**, where understanding upside/downside demand risk is essential for supply-chain decisions.

## 🎯 Objectives
- 📈 Build a Bayesian forecast model capturing trend, seasonality, and uncertainty  
- 🛒 Improve stock allocation and reorder accuracy  
- 📊 Visualize demand forecasts and credible intervals  
- 💡 Provide a decision-support tool using a Streamlit dashboard
